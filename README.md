# Inverse Problems Course

A project focused on harmonising different reconstruction methods in scenarios where hospitals only share reconstructed images rather than underlaying raw data.

## Overview

In this project we explore a toy problem of two distinct reconstruction strategies‚ÄîAlgo A and Algo B‚Äîdesigned to simulate the situation of non-shared raw data. The main aim is to harmonise these reconstructions. To achieve this, we propose a harmonisation framework that leverages a minimisation problem composed of:
- A fidelity term that enforces consistency between the harmonised output and the orginal image either from Algo A or Algo B.
- A CNN-based classification loss that distinguishes whether an image was reconstructed using Algo A or Algo B.

The minimisation problem formulated in the report is as follows:

![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?$$\min_{u}\left\{\|u-u_0\|^2&plus;\lambda\,\mathcal{L}_{\text{CNN}}(u)\right\}$$)



Here, u is the harmonised image, u‚ÇÄ represents the original image either from Algo A or Algo B, ùìõ‚ÇçCNN‚Çé(u) is the CNN classification loss, and Œª is a regularisation parameter.
